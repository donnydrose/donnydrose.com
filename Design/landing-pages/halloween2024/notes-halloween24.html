        <p>Here We Have a some Hideous Halloween Fun. Oh the Horror. Photo's from around my neighborhood in Brooklyn. The idea was to build a lo-fi yet fun webpage to celebrate the folks in my neighborhood who went all out for the rest of us.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take photos on a walk after work, usually 2am</li>
            <li>Use raw photo and footage, lo-fi, real theme, spooky, time management</li>
            <li>Use photo as header, get rid of links</li>
            <li>Use creepster font family from g-fonts</li>
            <li>Use orangered for color on h1 heading, and slightly more red hue for h2 heading</li>
            <li>Backup with websafe-colors</li>
            <li>Trim videos, use quick time</li>
            <li>Quick time formats to .mov file (not great for all browsers)</li>
            <li>Found 'Handbrake' - French encoding software</li>
            <li>Encoded .mov to .mp4 - most universal browser compatibility</li>
            <li>All videos are in portrait</li>
            <li>Learn better phone photography, but this works for now</li>
