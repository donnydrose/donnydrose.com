                        <h2>Why? Donny, Why?</h2>
                    </aside>
                    <p>In the past, I kept a lot of things inside—thoughts about the path I’m on, the journey of overcoming addiction, and the struggles I face with anxiety and other disorders. I used to write about it in poetry or songs, but it’s been a while since I’ve done that. I’ve always found comfort in creativity, whether it’s mixing a perfect drink, creating music, or now, designing websites and exploring sound. So, I figured, why not use this blog to keep myself open to change, to expression, and to authenticity?</p>

                        <p>This is where I can share the ups and downs of transitioning from bartending to UX and Sound Design, reflect on how I’m overcoming my personal struggles, and embrace the creative challenges of starting something new. Sharing this journey openly might get messy, real, and beautiful. It’s not always going to be neat, and certainly not easy, but I hope that by sharing these experiences, I can create a space where I can learn and grow—and hopefully, where you can too.</p>
                        
                        <p>So, here it is: a place for me to document what I’m learning, how I’m growing, and why this path has become so much more than just a career change. It’s become a way to rediscover myself. Welcome to my blog. I’m really glad you’re here. Cheers!

                        <h2>Technically Speaking</h2>
                    </aside>
                    <p>As I continue this journey from bartending to UX and Sound Design, I want this blog to be more than just personal stories. It’s going to be a resource where you can follow along with my creative process and see how I build things from the ground up.</p>
                       <p>Expect to see a blend of content focused on two main areas: design and music.
                        In the design world, I’ll be sharing my process as I build landing pages, create user experiences, and experiment with UI/UX principles. You’ll see screen recordings of my workflow, along with research and behind-the-scenes looks into the decisions I make when it comes to things like color theory, typography, layout, and user-centered design. I’ll also post tutorials or tips based on what I’m learning along the way. It’s going to be a lot of exploration, but I hope to keep it both informative and fun for those of you who are interested in learning about design.</p> 
                        <p>In addition to design, music is a huge part of my creative life. Expect to find some original soundtracks I create, whether it’s for video content or just new ideas I’m experimenting with. I’ll also explore sound design techniques and share the tools I use in my creative process. So whether you’re here to see my design evolution or discover some new music, there will be something for everyone. I'm excited to share both the highs and lows, the challenges and breakthroughs. It’s going to be a journey of growth, and I hope you’ll join me for it.</p>
